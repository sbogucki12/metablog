                    <u>Romeo and Juliet</u>, William Shakespeare.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The experience written about today is unique to my own job hunt, but I hope there is a lesson to be learned
                    in general that may be helpful to other career seekers.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>For vocation, I consider myself a web developer. I’ve been successful doing it, and have gone to school to
                    become one.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Many of my professional successes, however, have not been achieved via code. I’ve (co-) authored federal-level
                    regulatory policy, been promoted to management, led troops in combat, published a mostly non-technical
                    academic thesis. For a couple of examples.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>These experiences, as successful as I think they have been, have nevertheless become an obstacle to some
                    of my future pursuits.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>I market myself as a “developer”. On a resume, however, these achievements not related to programming really
                    only serve to distract potential employers from my ability to actually write quality code. Employers
                    are busy and, as such, their quick glance at my resume may suggest that I am unqualified for the exact
                    requirements of their developer position.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>There is a lesson to be learned:
                    <b>The key here, as in many things, is to manage expectations from the outset</b>.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>When one sees the title “developer” on a resume, there is an expectation to next see a familiar history of
                    achievements.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Now, imagine this: after being promoted to management in my last role, my office’s manager tasked me to hire
                    the replacement for the position that I had grown out of. When I began to write the job description seeking
                    a developer, this office manager stopped me, saying, “We don’t need a developer. We need another
                    <i>you</i>.”</p>
                <br/>
                <p>There is no way to sugarcoat this: I am really struggling to find a job right now. Another thing that should
                    not be sugarcoated: I am capable and, as proven by my work history, a benefit to any organization that
                    I join. If both things are true despite conflicting with each other, something external to both must
                    also be true. And that thing must be the source of the apparent dichotomy.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>That thing, I think, is the title, “developer”. While I’m capable as a developer, marketing myself exclusively
                    as that sets expectations that my professional experience doesn’t match. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>The power in one word, a title, can totally overshadow years’ worth of achievements and the promise of enormous
                    future potential.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Now, I approach employers from a different perspective. I offer my services as a
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbogucki12/" target="_blank">“business analyst” with technical and management experience</a>. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Literally nothing has changed about me, my potential, aptitude, or professional history. However, with that
                    simple adjustment, from one title to another, my history is no longer perceived as under-qualified, instead
                    I’m a senior in my field with a unique technical skillset beyond the normal expectations for the position.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>My career goal remains the same. Coding will be the primary duty of my next position. And, to that end, I’m
                    going to continue to work towards it as I have been. Today, for example, I’ll be working on a mobile
                    app using Xamarin, a technology about which I have long desired to become more capable. </p>
                <br/>

                <p>The adjustment is being made simply in how I establish the expectations for employers considering my qualifications
                    and experience. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Insisting that I am a “developer” (
                    <i>a title that, without which, can one not code?</i>) has been like trying to fit a round peg into a square
                    hole. And what would it say of my logical skills, so essential to a programmer, if I were insistently
                    incapable of adjusting my approach based on the practical observation of facts?</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Stepping away from any generalities, I’ll close today saying this about my own situation specifically:</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Some employers have an amazing product and they need only a vastly experienced developer to bring that item
                    to market. In that case, I may not be the right employee for them. Other employers, however, see a market
                    inefficiency ripe for exploitation but simply haven’t identified exactly how to take advantage.
                    <b>That</b> is where I come in. I can brainstorm on the strategic level to help craft the next big disruptive
                    idea, while having the technical capability to actually bring it to fruition.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>That may not be exactly what a “developer” does, but it’s what
                    <b>
                        <i>I</i>
                    </b> can do.
                    <p>
                        </br>
