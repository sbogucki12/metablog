            <p>For a while now, I’ve been studying programming languages, mostly C# and some JavaScript. Without, unfortunately,
                taking a step back and considering what end these languages would serve as the means.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>But, before we get to that…</p>
            <br/>
            <p>While languages interest me, the other night, I was reading about some things really compelling: the TCP/IP
                stack, HTTP, ports, networks, and how the internet actually works.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Which led to a simple but, for me, paradigm-shifting observation:</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>
                <i>Nearly everything I build is just a tool to provide data to/from a data source to allow for user manipulation.
                    Once you strip away all the abstracting layers of complexity, that’s really the key functionality
                    of anything I build. Data in / Data out.</i>
            </h4>
            <br/>
            <p>That observation led to monumental-thought-number-two: Why can’t users directly pull from the data source
                and, if they can’t, what currently exists in programming that is closest to that (“that” being: “allowing
                users to act on data directly at the data’s source, or with as few possible steps between source and
                user”).
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>In other words, I was sort of asking, “why can’t we just write JavaScript events that directly execute SQL
                commands?” Which, I don’t know, maybe we can; that’s not really the point here.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I never really answered that question. But, by asking it, I traveled a journey of discovery that taught me
                more about Entities in the .NET framework and the general functionality of web APIs.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I was finally taking the time to consider the means/end topic that I mentioned at the top of this post. (Which,
                as my lesson to any aspiring developer, is a consideration that you should probably enjoy much earlier
                in your journey than did I.)</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I had been for too long formulaically participating in courses, copying code, reading, studying, what have
                you. And only now, a few nights ago, sincerely considering “what does this all do?” Over time, my goal
                of learning C# was becoming the tree blinding me from seeing the forest.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In the end, I was left unsatisfied with the solutions I was being provided to these lofty questions. At least
                by the tools then at my disposal: C#, .NET. Entity Framework, SQL. Once I became inquisitive about the
                big picture, I subsequently became more disappointed with the answers that I was receiving.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In summation: To my simple brain, an ORM, controllers, services, etc., all written in a language different
                than the one used by the client suddenly seemed like overhead that hindered instead of aided the goal
                of getting the job done.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <b>“There has to be a better way.” </b> — Steve, like 5 days ago.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In pondering this, my subsequent thought was “why is everything in JavaScript an object? Shouldn’t everything
                be a record? A “record” in this case referring to a SQL database definition of a record.” Ultimately,
                what I was striving for, I think, was the least amount of serialization and parsing of any individual
                element of data to/from client/server. Why can’t the data at its source be exactly the same as the data
                presented to the user? Why all this parsing, stringifying, serialization, casting… WHY?!?</p>
            <br/>
            <p>So, that was the little intellectual calisthenic that my brain exercised for a few days.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>And then … THEN … I was reintroduced to Nodejs.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Here’s the thing: I was actually introduced to Node a while back, But, then, I didn’t know of the problem
                that it was solving. So, to me, it seemed a less mature approach to doing the things C#, .NET were then
                doing well for me.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Now … NOW … My perception is the complete opposite.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Now, when I think of C#, .NET, Java, whatever, relative to Node and Mongo, I just see square pegs for a round
                hole. Whereas Node and Mongo are JavaScript tools for a JavaScript world.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>If I step back to my thoughts of a few nights ago and really play out my desire for seamless UI — to — data
                paradigm, the Mongo/Node stack would be pretty close to what I’d ultimately imagine. Though, perhaps
                in my dream scenario, with fewer callback/promises to master!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In the end, this post isn’t really to champion Node/Mongo over other stacks. That’d be super presumptuous
                because I am way too inexperienced to really know the intricate benefits, consequences, security considerations,
                etc. This post is really about what works for me, personally.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>And, with Node, more than with C#, .NET, or even Angular, I feel like I am learning something that feels
                intimately natural to the way that I think.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Studying Node is more than just taking classes to gain a skill that’ll satisfy some future employer. I’m
                learning about something that legitimately fascinates me, is immediately useful, and, perhaps most tantalizing,
                reveals even deeper, more powerful functionality with each aspect of it that I learn.</p>

                <b>PS:</b> A friend recommended two books that I am currently reading that I absolutely love. If you read
                the post above and thought to yourself, “Hmm… I sorta think like that”, then these two books will both
                surely appeal to you as well. Neither are cutting-edge modern, but both describe complex systems in digestible
                narration that breaks down intricate tools/concepts to their historical and simplistic roots, revealing
                that the most daunting modern inventions, in the end, perform ancient, simple functions. I highly recommend
                checking both books out:</p>
