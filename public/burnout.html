                <br/>
                <p>I said that it couldn’t happen to me…</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Though I’ve been into web development my entire life – or, well, since middle school – it’s been since June
                    that I have been focused on it professionally, literally studying and/or building every single day. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>As the calendar flipped over to 2018, I sensed for the first time my motivation waning.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>It doesn’t tell the whole story to call what I was experiencing simply “burnout”. Though that was certainly
                    part of the case. There was also some frustration.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>During the course of my studies, I had become pretty proficient with C# and building web tools via Microsoft’s
                    .NET Framework. To expand my capabilities, I started to learn more deeply about JavaScript, including
                    how to do .NET-like things, such as write server-side code with JavaScript via NodeJs. Upon doing this,
                    I discovered that I much preferred JavaScript to C#. And for a very simple reason: </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        <i>Node simply allows me to most easily build and share the things that I imagine in my head.</i>
                    </b>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>At the end of the day, building things is the name of the game. That is to say that knowing any programming
                    language just for the sake of knowing it – and not applying it – isn’t in itself valuable. All things
                    being equal, JavaScript, to me, makes building things much more straight forward than does .NET. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Of course, I’m not the only developer to have drawn this conclusion. Which likely explains why, as soon as
                    this was revealed to me, I started to receive more job opportunities … for .NET positions.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>So, my frustration is an internal struggle. I’m about to reach the threshold of my financial savings that
                    will force me take on a fulltime job, whether it is one that really appeals to me or not. But, in this
                    period right up until the brink of that monetary cliff, I’m holding out for the perfect JavaScript position.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>But, let’s be real: being jobless is a burden to bear. It makes one question their longterm financial stability,
                    obviously, and, less obviously, it makes one question their qualifications, potential, and value. So,
                    when burnout does begin to creep in, being unemployed only exacerbates it. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>So, the real crux of the conflict is that the weight of this struggle is self-imposed. I could accept
                    <b>
                        <i>A</i>
                    </b> job, or I can continue to prolong this bet I’ve placed on myself, and hold out for
                    <b>
                        <i>THE</i>
                    </b> job. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Clearly, I’ve chosen the latter option, at least until the end of this month. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>But, I have a plan.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I’m going to continue to study what interests me, namely JavaScript, especially server-side. If .NET positions
                    are easier to come by, it stands to reason that Node positions are more competitive. But I know what
                    I want and I know what I have to do to get what I want. So, the plan is to work myself to the point that
                    my comfortability with Node is such that I can easily teach its key concepts, callbacks, promises, socket.io,
                    etc, to my peers. Because, to me, the best test of one's sufficiency in acquiring a concept is the ability
                    to convey it to others.
                </p>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>As for the burnout, there is a plan to combat that as well. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>I took an inventory of what activities I enjoy outside of coding. One of those is lame, but I had to admit
                    to myself my inherent interest in it: political gossip. I have tried to avoid it, but I’ve been a wonk
                    my whole life and it only adds to all the internal conflict to fight it, so I’ve embraced it. I also
                    like to run, play and watch basketball, and listen to podcasts.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>For a while, while really deep in my studies, I was avoiding all of these activities in an effort to focus
                    only on code. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Now, I’m going to do the opposite. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>I’m going to make time for all the things that I enjoy outside of code, but I’m going to make that time conditional
                    on completing daily study tasks. Like, today for example, my goals are to: </p>
                <br/>
                <ol>
                    <li>Write and publish this blog;</li>
                    <li>Build a socket.io chat application; </li>
                    <li>Complete one Interview Cake algorithmic challenge.</li>

                </ol>
                <br/>
                <p>Do those three things and then I can -- without guilt -- read all I want about our President’s mental stability,
                    go for another run, and/or listen to an episode of the
                    <a href="https://wondery.com/wondery/shows/tidesofhistory/" target="_blank">Tides of History</a>. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Hopefully, as I resume my studies in this new year, I’ll also write a little bit more. Because I find this
                    also helpful in relieving the latent anxiety of the entire situation. Plus, when it comes to tech, my
                    own learning is reinforced when I think though a newly obtained concept in order to explain it to others.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>So, thanks for reading. And happy coding in 2018! </p>
