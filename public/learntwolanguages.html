                <p>To Best Learn Your First Programming Language, Try Learning Two!</p>
                <br/>

                <p>One of the reasons that I have become so enamored
                    <a href="/public/archive1" target="_blank">with writing server-side JavaScript code</a> is because I have some experience doing the same with C#.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p>The advice being provided in this article is specific to C# (via the .NET Framework) and JavaScript (via
                    NodeJS). But it could also apply to any two other languages that are used to do the same job. So, say,
                    Ruby and Java, both of which can also be used to write server-side code. Or, for another example, two
                    client-side JavaScript frameworks: Angular and React. </p>
                <br/>

                <p>No matter the two languages (or frameworks. Or, whatever), if they both perform the same tasks but in different
                    ways, the point here is that
                    <b>
                        <i>learning one can actually help you learn the other</i>
                    </b>.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The idea is to be introduced to a concept in one language, familiarize yourself with it, and then find how
                    that concept is applied in the other language. By doing this, you will gain a broader understanding of
                    the concept in the first language while, likely, picking up the concept in the second language quickly.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p>That might not make a lot of sense in the abstract. So, let’s consider an example. </p>
                <br/>

                <p>Using Node, a developer can write a simple web server by utilizing the Express module. From here on, in this
                    article, we will call this the “Express server”. The Express server contains several parts including
                    the view engine, the route handlers, and middleware, among others. For this example, let us just consider
                    middleware.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p>Understand that, in the Express server, a request is received from the client. The Express server acts on
                    that request by sending a response back to the client and, perhaps before that, using the request in
                    some way to shape that response. For example, if the Express server’s job is to “add 2” before sending
                    a response, the server will take the data received in the client’s request (the number, “4”, for example),
                    add 2 to it, and then send a response back to the client; in this case, the number “6”. </p>
                <br/>

                <p>Though this is simplifying it a bit, actions taken by the Express server from the time of receiving the request
                    from the client to the point of sending a response back are performed by functions called “middleware”.
                    So, in the example above, middleware was invoked when the Express server “added 2” to the response. </p>
                <br/>

                <p>In an Express server, the code for middleware looks like this: </p>
                <br/>

                <center>
                    <img src="./images/nodemiddleware.JPG" width="100%" height="100%">
                </center>
                <br/>
                <center>
                    <i>Image from
                        <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html" target="_blank">ExpressJS.com</a>. In this case, the middleware logs information about the request to the console
                        every time the server receives a request -- common middleware task. </i>
                </center>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <p>So, to recap, a developer can write an Express server using JavaScript that takes in a client request, uses
                    it via middleware, and then sends back to the client a response. </p>
                <br/>

                <p>Guess what? A developer can write a .NET server using C# that takes in a client request, uses it via middleware,
                    and then sends back to the client a response. </p>
                <br/>

                <p>That’s right! Once you discover the concept of middleware in NodeJS/Express, all it takes is to google “.NET
                    middleware” to find that the same concept exists there as well. The code for middleware in .NET looks
                    like this: </p>
                <br/>

                <center>
                    <img src="./images/netmiddleware.JPG" width="100%" height="100%">
                    <i>Image from
                        <a href="http://jakeydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fundamentals/middleware.html" target="_blank">ReadTheDocs.io</a>. In this example, the app.use statements invoke middleware actions.</i>
                </center>
                <br/>

                <p>Of course, knowing that the concept is shared by the two languages won’t solidify your learning alone. However,
                    by contrasting how middleware works in .NET relative to how it works in the Express server can be helpful
                    in gaining a fuller understanding of both. And, in some cases, where the concept may not initially make
                    sense in one language, you may find it more intuitive in the other. So, you internalize it via the language
                    in which it first makes the most sense, and then use that knowledge to overcome the confusion in the
                    other language.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p>This technique has been super helpful. And can be extrapolated in interesting ways. That is to say that many
                    concepts are shared by all levels of programming, just in different manifestations. What do I mean? </p>
                <br/>

                <p>An example: </p>
                <br/>

                <p>In client-side JavaScript frameworks, there is a
                    <a href="https://toddmotto.com/stateful-stateless-components" target="_blank">concept of “statefulness”</a> which can be somewhat difficult to wrap one’s head around. We won’t try
                    here. But what we will share is that at the lowest level of the internet’s mechanics, when data is actually
                    passing through ports, there too
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateful_firewall" target="_blank">exists a concept of “statefulness”</a>. And the statefulness at that low level, while not exactly the
                    same, is inherently similar to the statefulness that exists at the much higher level of the client. </p>
                <br/>

                <p>So, being curious about the concept at one level can help inform your knowledge of it at the other. You might
                    be surprised to learn just how related they are!</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Ultimately, the point is that it may intuitively seem that learning two languages is more difficult than
                    learning one. However, if you think of the exercise as evaluating two techniques to solve the same problem,
                    you may find you learn more about both than you would have ever learned about either individually! </p>
