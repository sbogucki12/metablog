# meta. Blog. 

A section of my personal site where I may share my thoughts, mostly on technology and the developer life.  This is meant to be super simple. The server is written in JavaScript, via Node.  I used express to serve the public folder which contains just basic static HTML and CSS files. 

## Development Process

1. Used npm init to set up Node app.
2. Imported express to set up an express app.
3. Used express's built-in express.static function to serve the "public" folder. 
4. Created index.html and stylesheet.css in the public folder. 
5. Imported CSS bootstrap via CDN and wrote out the blog's basic layout. 
6. Deployed to Heroku. 

## Timeline

+ Day One (12/26/2017): Wrote server, setup layout, deployed to Heroku and first commit to gitHub.
